# springboot-rsocketmetadatapush-example
![Build](https://github.com/gregwhitaker/springboot-rsocketmetadatapush-example/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

An example of using Metadata Push with [RSocket](http://rsocket.io) and Spring Boot.

This example consists of an RSocket service, `hello-service`, that returns hello messages in the format specified during connection
setup or by the format specified as an update to the metadata via metadata push.

## Building the Example
Run the following command to build the example:

    ./gradlew clean build
    
## Running the Example
Follow the steps below to run the example:

1. Start the `hello-service` by running the following command:

        ./gradlew :hello-service:bootRun
        
2. In a new terminal, run the following command to start the `hello-client`:

        ./gradlew :hello-client:bootRun --args="Bob"
        
    If successful, you will see the following in the terminal:

        : Started HelloClientApplication in 0.967 seconds (JVM running for 1.336)
        : Sending hello request 1...
        : Response: Hello, Bob! [clientId: 'greg_demo_client']
        : Pushing new hello message format via METADATA_PUSH: Bonjour, %s!
        : Sending hello request 2...
        : Response: Bonjour, Bob! [clientId: 'greg_demo_client']
        
    Notice that the first hello message uses the format `Hello, {name}!`. The message format is then updated to `Bonjour, {name}!` 
    via RSocket metadata push and a new request is sent through to show that the message has been updated.

    Also, notice that the `clientId` metadata in both scenarios remains as it was set during the RSocket connection setup.
